# gaming-hours-log

first thoughts:

-simple webapp to track gaming hours
-user can add game titles, icons maybe
-user can input session start time, end time
-start and end time can be entered manually or can be clicked as a button (start time button click would register the current time as start time, and end time button click would calculate the difference between current time and start time)
-could have simple login system, save data for each user
-data options for current day, past week, month, year, etc.
-graph generation for each of the above
-weekly report emailed to each user perhaps (with graphs??)
-user can set goals? weekly, daily, etc
-more to come
